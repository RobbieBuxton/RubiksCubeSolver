# Directory Information for `robot`

The `robot` directory contains only boilerplate code needed for the robot to
function.
An exception is made for `[root]/robot/src/main.cpp`, which is the main file
written as an entry point for the executable that controls the robot.

This boilerplate code is the code included with the SDK for said robot.
