\section{Group Organisation}

\subsection{Work Distribution and Coordination}

In our initial group meeting, we planned out how we wanted to first approach 
creating the emulator. We decided to initially work together on designing the 
data types and structures, and then implemented the decoder and the overarching 
fetch-execute cycle. \\ \\
After this was completed, we distributed the four categories
of instruction between the team members. Fawwaz worked on branch, Robert on data
processing, Edward on the single data transfer and Wojtek on multiply. After
code was committed it was reviewed by other teammates. Once all the subsections were complete we worked together as a team to fix bugs
and remove redundancies in the code. 

\subsection{Evaluation and Future Strategies}

Our primary method of communication is Discord where we have a video meeting at 
11 am every day to discuss how the project is going and where we plan to go next.
We also communicate frequently in the chat which means that the team has a good
idea of the state of the project and any problems can be resolved promptly. \\ \\
What we would like to do in the future is find ways to reduce the amount of 
downtime when team is waiting for bottlenecks to be completed. We think we can 
achieve this by spending more time planning before starting on the next section.
